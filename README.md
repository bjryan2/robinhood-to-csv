# Robinhood ->  CSV
---

Track your Robinhood order history like a sensible adult! This script / library will dump your Robinhood order history into a .csv of your choosing! 

This is pretty chill if you want to manage your stocks in google finance or excel. Just don't sue me if this script doesn't export your history right, submit a PR instead :) 


### Usage:

`python run.py -u <username> -p <password> -f <file?>`
